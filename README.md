# memory

What is this doing?

This code is creating an application to download a file from a URL and run it from memory in C++. The code first initializes and sets up CURL, before setting the URL and other necessary options. It then downloads the file into memory and runs it from memory. Finally, it cleans up all the data and resources used by the application.
